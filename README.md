# CompArchFinal

This reposityory contains the as-is repository from my Computer Archetecture Final taken at the University of Hertfordshire under M. L. Walters. See [this report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q_Sf_aHpKXkYybeo66NlhOU7TiC9PrwrxmOFCQUQCMc/edit?usp=sharing) for a sucinct guide to my work. 

## Abstract

The student implemented a real time clock on a popular microcontroller and development board. The time was displayed and input read from an LCD Keypad Shield. The program displays a 24 hour clock with second accuracy and can be set to any 24 hour time to half of a minute accuracy. The time can be set via 5 buttons which are conveyed as analog voltages to the ADC of the microcontroller. The software, written in assembly, utilizes interrupts to respond to timing and user input.

## Directory Structure

Messier Than I'd like. I'll plan to look through and clean it up. Until them, [the report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q_Sf_aHpKXkYybeo66NlhOU7TiC9PrwrxmOFCQUQCMc/edit?usp=sharing) has the most relvant code listed on page 6.
