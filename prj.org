* Project Planning
** Main Objectives
 - Clock Function
   - Timer Interupt
   - State storage and update
   - Display Function
 - Alarm Function
 - Stopwatch Function
** Secondary Objectives
   - Time Setting Menu
     - Input Interupts
     - State Management
     - Display Function
* Technical Notes
** Timing
*** RC Oscilator
 - Can be callibarated to be pretty accurate
 - Can be set as system clock
   This is probably how I will need to set it to get the accurate clk signal to the Timer/Counter internally
*** Clk I/O
 - Clock line sent to timer
 - Does this also scale with the cpu prescaling?
*** Timer/Counter 16-bit
 - Can Source the system clock as selected by the CPU. (See the Clk I/O)
 - CTC mode will allow for finer calibration
